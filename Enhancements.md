I want there to be a trouble shooting section in this documentation as an attempt to allow users to solve common issues and have resolutions. 

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Identify Common Issues**: Research or infer common problems users might face based on the setup steps. You can also check the issues list on the repository for common problems reported by other users.
2. **Draft Resolutions**: Write clear and concise resolutions for each identified issue.
3. **Organize the Section**: Structure the troubleshooting section for easy navigation.
4. **Add the Section to the Guide**: Integrate the troubleshooting section into the existing documentation.

### Example Troubleshooting Section
#### 1. Identify Common Issues

Some common issues might include:
- Unable to access the Digital Payments Orbital Adapter configuration page
- Errors in Digital Payments Technical Information configuration
- Issues with Orbital Gateway configuration

#### 2. Draft Resolutions

Write resolutions for each identified issue. Here are some examples:

#### Issue 2: Errors in Digital Payments Technical Information Configuration

**Symptoms**:
- Incorrect values entered for Digital Payments Tenant ID, Subaccount ID, or Token Keys URL.
- Errors when saving configuration details.

**Resolution**:
1. Double-check the values for the following properties:
    - `Digital Payments Tenant ID`: This should be the `uaa.tenantid` property from the M2M adapter service key.
    - `Digital Payments Subaccount ID`: This should be the `uaa.subaccountid` property from the M2M adapter service key.
    - `Digital Payments Token Keys URL`: Ensure the URL follows the format `https://digitalpayments.authentication.<region>.hana.ondemand.com/token_keys`.
2. Ensure there are no typos or extra spaces in the values.
3. Contact J.P. Morgan support if you need to confirm the correct values for these properties.
